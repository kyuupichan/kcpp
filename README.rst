Why write a preprocessor in Python?
===================================

Good question.  Essentially because Python makes it very easy to refactor code to find the
cleanest and most efficient implementation of an idea.  It is ideal for a reference
implementation that can be transcoded to C or C++.  I believe the result would be much
better than could be achieved from scratch in a similar timeframe in those languages.

I was a co-maintainer of GCC's preprocessor 1999 to 2003.  During this time the
preprocessor was converted from a standalone executable that would write its output to a
pipe, to be an integrated "libary" (libcpp) into the compiler proper.  Furthermore, around
2005-2007 I wrote a complete C99 front-end in C (not public), and I rewrote its
implementation of a generic target floating point emulator using bignum integer arithmetic
from C to C++ and contributed to the Clang project, which needed such an emulator, as
APFloat.cpp in around 2007.  From writing a C front-end, it became very clear how hard it
is to refactor and restructure C or C++ code to do things more simply or in better ways,
which generally means it is not done.  Another reason refactoring is avoided is fear of
breaking things subtly owing to poor testsuite coverage, or alternatively having to
manually update hundreds or thousands of tests to account for changes in output that a
refactoring might cause.  A quick glance at the diagnostic and expression parsing and
evalation subsystems of GCC and Clang today, and trying to understand them, shows creeping
complexity and loss of clarity.  Clang's original preprocessor was fairly clean and
efficient - something that was only partly true of GCC's libcpp at one point - but for
both those days are long gone.

I learnt Python in 2012, and since that time have come to love its simplicity and
elegance.  In 2016 with ElectrumX that I showed that Python can provide efficient
processing of heavy workloads.  More recently I have become interested in learning C++
properly (I used to be able to write basic C++ from around the mid 1990s, but at the time
I much preferred C, and I have never been good at idiomatic C++ as I've never worked on a
large and decent C++ codebase).  I took a look at drafts of the most recent C++ standard
and decided "Aha! Let's try something insane and attempt a C++23 preprocessor in Python."
I started this crazy project at around the end of January 2025.

Can a performant and standards-conforming preprocessor be written in Python?  You be the
judge.


What about the other open source C preprocessors?
=================================================

There are several publicly available preprocessors, usually written in C or C++, and most
claim to be standards conforming.  In reality they are not, particularly when it comes to
the very many corner cases, or implementing more recent features like processing generic
UTF-8 source, __VA_OPT__, and handling the details of UCNs.  None make an effort at
high-quality diagnostics and their codebases do not appeal as something to build on.

To my surprise about three Python preprocessors exist as well, but from what I could see
they have similar defects to their C and C++ counterparts, and have other goals such as
visualization (cpip is a cool example of this).  They don't appear to be actively
maintained.

I invite you to compare the code of other preprocessors with that of kcpp.


Goals
=====

This project shall develop a standards-conforming and efficient (to the extent possible in
Python) preprocessor that provides high quality diagnostics that is host and target
independent (in the compiler sense).  The code should be clean and easy to understand -
good examples are kcpp's diagnostics subsystem, and expression parser and evaluator.

Equally, it should be a "reference implementation" that can be easily transcoded to a
clean and efficient C or C++ implementation by a decent programmer of those languages.
There is no reason such an implementation cannot be on at least on a par with Clang or GCC
for performance and quality, and at the same time more compact and easier to understand.

Some design choices I have made (such as treating source files as binary rather than as
Python Unicode strings, and not using Python's built-in Unicode support) are because those
things don't exist in C and C++.  I want it to be fairly easy to translate the Python code
directly translate to C or C++ equivalents.

I probably will do such a transcoding to C++ once the Python code is mostly complete and
cleaned up.  This will be later in 2025 as part of my goal of learning C++ properly.


Features that are essentially complete
======================================

The following are bascially done and fully working, modulo small cleanups and
improvements, to the C++23 specifications:

- lexing
- macro expansion, including __VA_OPT__ and whitespace correctness
- predefined and built-in macros
- interpretation of literals
- expression parsing
- expression evaluation
- conversion of Unicode character names to codepoints.  I implemented the Python code
  based on the ideas described by cor3ntin at
  https://cor3ntin.github.io/posts/cp_to_name/, but added some ideas and improvements of
  my own to achieve 20+% tighter compaction - see unicode/cp_name_db.py.
- display of the macro expansion stack in diagnostics with precise caret locations and
  range highlights
- the diagnostic framework.  Colourized output to a Unicode terminal is supported,
  as are translations (none provided!).  The framework could be hooked up to an IDE.


Incomplete or Missing
=====================

The following are missing, or work in progress, but the framework is already in place so
that adding them is pretty easy now:

- #include, #pragma
- _Pragma operator
- multiple-include optimisation
- _has_include
- _has_cpp_attribute
- avoidance of unwanted concatenation in preprocessed output

C++ modules - I've not fully figured out how these work in C++ or how they interact with
the preprocessor.  Unlikely to be tackled until some kind of real frontend exists.

Precompiled headers - possibly an idea and I suspect largely overlaps with modules.
Again, Python is a good place to experiment before attempting an implementation in C++.

Makefile output and other features are possibilities going forwards.


Future
======

It should be easy to extend the code to provide hooks for other code or analysis tools
needing a preprocessor back-end.  A logical future project is to write a front-end in
Python too.

Feature requests are welcome.


Documentation
=============

Soon.  The code is well-commented and reasonably clean though - it shouldn't be hard to
figure out.


Tests
=====

I have a testuite for the code but I am keeping it private.  Test case submissions for the
public repo (using pytest) are welcome.

Bug reports are also welcome.
